Virtual Stack Machine implementation in C. Just a toy stack machine that I wanted to implement after reading about [Philae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_(spacecraft)), its CPU ([RTX2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTX2010)), [FORTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) and [virtual machines in C](http://blog.felixangell.com/blog/virtual-machine-in-c).
